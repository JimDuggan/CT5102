## Additional Function Features
- Functions
  + ... argument 
  + do.call() function
- Functionals
  + sapply()
  + lapply()
  + apply()

## ... argument 
- There is a special argument called ... 
- This argument will match any arguments not otherwise matched, and can be easily passed on to other functions
```{r,echo=T}
mysum <- function(v,...){
  sum(v,...)
}

x <- c(1,2,3, NA)
mysum(x)
mysum(x,na.rm=T)
```
  
## do.call() function

- Calling a function, given a list of arguments

```{r,echo=T}
args <- list(c(1:3),NA,na.rm=T)
args
do.call(sum, args)
```



## Functionals
- A functional is a function that takes a function as an input and returns a vector as output
- Commonly used as an alternative for loops
- Common ones
  + sapply()
  + apply()
  + lapply()
  

## Common Pattern (Wickham 2015)
- Create a container for output
- Apply f() to each component of the list
- Fill the container with the results
```{r, echo=F,out.width='50%'}
 knitr::include_graphics("images/07 Apply.png")
```

## my_sapply()
```{r,echo=T}
my_sapply <- function(x,f,...){
  out <- vector("list",length(x))
  for (i in seq_along(x)){
    out[[i]] <- f(x[[i]],...)
  }
  unlist(out)
}

my_sapply(1:5,
          function(v)v*2-10)
```
## sapply()
- The general form of the **sapply(x,f,fargs)** function is as follows:
  + **x** is the target vector or list
  + **f** is the function to be called and applied to each element
  + **fargs** are the optional set of arguments that can be applied to the function f.
- sapply() returns a vector

```{r,echo=T}
x <- 1:3
y <- sapply(x,function(v)v*2)
y
```


## sapply() - processing a quadratic equation

```{r,echo=T}
time <- seq(-10,10,by=0.1)
y <- sapply(time,function(x,a,b,c)a*x^2+b*x+c,a=2,b=-2,c=20)
m <- matrix(nrow=length(time),ncol=2)
colnames(m)<- c("Time","Y")
m[,1] <- time
m[,2] <- y
m[1:5,]
```

## Plotting the results

```{r,echo=T,fig.width=5, fig.height=2.5}
ggplot(data=data.frame(m),aes(x=Time,y=Y))+
         geom_point()
```

## Matrices
 
|| Homogenous| Heterogenous |
|:------|:----------|:-----------|
|1d | Atomic Vector|List|
|2d | **Matrix**|Data Frame/Tibble|
|nd | Array| |

- A matrix can be initialized from a vector, where the numbers of rows and columns are specified. 
- R stores matrices by column-major order, and by default matrices are filled in this manner. 


## Declaring a matrix

```{r,echo=T}
a <- matrix(1:6,ncol=3,nrow=2)
a
dim(a)
```

## Adding rows through rbind()

```{r,echo=T}
a
a1 <- rbind(a,7:9)
a1
dim(a1)
```

## Adding columns through cbind()

```{r,echo=T}
a
a2 <- cbind(a,7:8)
a2
dim(a2)
```

## Naming rows and columns

```{r,echo=T}
rownames(a) <- c("R1","R2")
a
colnames(a) <- c("C1","C2","C3")
a
```

## Subsetting Matrices
- The most common way of subsetting 2d matrix is a simple generalisation of 1d subsetting
- Supply a 1d index for each dimension, separated by a comma
- Blank subsetting is useful, as it lets you keep all rows or all columns

```{r,echo=T}
b <- matrix(1:9,ncol=3,nrow=3)
rownames(b) <- c("R1","R2","R3") # optional
colnames(b) <- c("C1","C2","C3") # optional
b
```

## Subsetting by row index - 1/2
```{r,echo=T}
b
b[1:2,]
b[c("R1","R2"),]

```

## Subsetting by row index - 2/2
```{r,echo=T}
b
b[c(T,T,F),]
b[-c(1,2),]
```

## Subsetting by column index - 1/2
```{r,echo=T}
b
b[,1:2]
b[,c("C1","C3")]

```

## Subsetting by column index - 2/2
```{r,echo=T}
b
b[1:2,c(T,T,F)]
b[1:2,-c(1,3)]
```

## Matrix Operators/Functions
 
|Operator| Description |
|:----------|:-----------|
| A * B |Element-wise multiplication|
| A / B |Element-wise division|
| A %*% B |Matrix Multiplication|
| t(A) |Transpose of A|
| eigen(A) |List of eigenvalues/eigenvectors for A|


## apply() - process matrices/data frames

The general form of this function is **apply(m, dimcode, f, fargs)**, where:
  - m is the target matrix
  - dimcode identifies whether itâ€™s a row or column target. The number 1 applies to rows, whereas 2 applies to columns
  - f is the function to be called, and fargs are the optional set of arguments that can be applied to the function f.
  
```{r,echo=T}
m <- matrix(1:10,nrow = 2)
m
apply(m,1,sum) # sum the row
apply(m,2,sum) # sum the columns
```


## Challenge 3.1
- Create a 10x10 matrix to represent connections between people on social media (random seed=100)
- Label the people [A..J], with named rows and columns.
- Randomly populate the matrix with 1s and 0s. The number 1 means someone follows/is followed by another person.  Ensure that all diagonals are 0 (you should use an appropriate R matrix operation for this).
- Each row contains information on the people a person follows. 
- Each column contains information on who follows a person. 


## Challenge 3.2 
- Create a matrix of grades for subjects (50 students x 5 subjects)
- Each column is a different subject, with grades drawn from a random normal distribution (function rnorm). - Name the columns
- Each row is a students result
- Use apply to calculate the average mark for each student, and add this result as a new column to the matrix

## Replacement Functions
 
- Replacement functions act like they modify their arguments in place, and have the special name `xxx<-`
- They typically have two arguments (x and value), although they can have more, and they must return the modified object
- The new value must be passed as a parameter named **value**

## dim() function
```{r,echo=T}
x <- 1:6
x

dim(x) <- c(2,3)
x
```


## Replacement Function Example
```{r,echo=T}
`second<-` <- function(x, value){
  x[2] <- value
  x
}

x <- 1:5
second(x) <- 78
x
```


## Summary - Functionals and Matrices
- Functionals are functions that takes a function as an input and returns a vector as output (can be used as a looping structure)
  + The apply family in R are functionals (**apply**, **sapply**, **lapply**)
  + The package **purrr** is now being used instead of **apply**
- Matrix is used for 2-d homogenous data. Filtering rules similar to atomic vectors. Matric operations are (by default) element-wise, and matrix multiplication also supported.

```{r,echo=F,fig.width=2, fig.height=2}
# this is a hack to call plot but make the plot tiny
plot(1:1,axes=FALSE,xlab = "", ylab="",cex = .001)
```
