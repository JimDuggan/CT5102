## Recap - R Data Types
 
|| Homogenous| Heterogenous |
|:------|:----------|:-----------|
|1d | Atomic Vector|**List** |
|2d | Matrix|Data Frame/Tibble|
|nd | Array| |

- Lists are different from atomic vectors because their elements can be of any type, including lists.
- list() creates a list, instead of c()


## Creating a list

```{r,echo=T}
x <- list(1:3, "a", c(T,F,T), c(1.2, 1.3, 1.4))
str(x)
```

## Subsetting Lists
- Works in the same way as subsetting an atomic vector
- Using [ will always return a list
- [[ and $ pull out the contents of a list
- If list x is a train carrying objects, then x[[5]] is the object in car 5, x[4:6] is a train of cars 4-6”  @RLangTip

```{r, echo=F,out.width='90%'}
 knitr::include_graphics("images/04 List.png")
```

 
## Example

```{r,echo=T}
x <- list(1:3, c(T,F,T))
x[1]
str(x[1])
x[[1]]
str(x[[1]])
``` 

## Naming list elements

```{r,echo=T}
x <- list(el1=1:3, el2=c(T,F,T))
x
``` 

## The $ operator
- $ is a shorthand operator, where x$y is equivalent to x[[“y”,exact=FALSE]]
- Often used to access variables in a data frame
- $ does partial matching
```{r,echo=T}
x
x$el1
x$el2
``` 

## Visualising Lists
- Lists have rounded corners. 
- Atomic vectors have square corners
- Children are drawn inside their parent, and have a slightly darker background

```{r,echo=T}
y <- list(c(1,2),c(3,4)) 
``` 

```{r, echo=F,out.width='50%'}
 knitr::include_graphics("images/05 List Vis.png")
```

## Further List Example

```{r,echo=T}
a <- list(el1=1:3,el2="a string",el3=pi,el4=list(-1,-5))
``` 

```{r, echo=F,out.width='70%'}
 knitr::include_graphics("images/05a List Vis.png")
```

## Summarising the list structure
```{r,echo=T}
str(a)
``` 

## Exploring element 4

```{r,echo=T}
str(a[4])
``` 

```{r, echo=F,out.width='60%'}
 knitr::include_graphics("images/05b List Vis.png")
```


## Exploring the fourth element (a list)

```{r,echo=T}
str(a[[4]])
str(a[[4]][1])
str(a[[4]][[1]])
str(a[[4]][[2]])
``` 

## Visualising these operations

```{r, echo=F,out.width='80%'}
 knitr::include_graphics("images/05c List Vis.png")
```

  
## Challenge 2.1

```{r,echo=T}
l1 <- list(1:4,list(2:4,c(T,F,T)),1:10)
``` 

- What is the structure of l1[[2]]?
- What is the structure of l1[[2]][1]?
- Sum all of the elements of the first element of the embedded list
- Explain the following result

```{r,echo=T}
 unlist(l1[[2]])
``` 

## Using Lists
- Are the basis of many S3 objects that are returned from regression functions (e.g. linear regression)
- The basis for data frames (the $ operator identifies columns)
```{r,echo=T,fig.width=5, fig.height=2}
 ggplot(data=faithful)+
  geom_point(aes(x=waiting,y=eruptions))
``` 
  
## lm function - Returns a list of 12
```{r,echo=T}
mod <- lm(eruptions ~ waiting, data=faithful) 
mod$coefficients
class(mod)
coefficients(mod)
str(coefficients(mod))
``` 

## Summary - Lists
- Lists are vectors, but can store many different types
- [] returns a subset of a list (as a list), 
- [[]] returns the list contents
- The function **unlist()** will convert a list to an atomic vector
- The tag ($) operator is very useful (and used in data frames)
- In regression (and other machine learning algorithms in R), result information is returned as a list

## Functions
- A function is a group of instructions that:
  + takes input, 
  + uses the input to compute other value, and 
  + returns a result (Matloff 2009). 
- Functions are a fundamental building block of R
- Users of R should adopt the habit of creating simple functions which will make their work more effective and also more trustworthy (Chambers 2008). 
- Functions:
  + are declared using the function reserved word 
  + are objects


## General Form
- **function** (*arguments*) *expression*
- arguments gives the arguments, separated by commas.
- Expression (body of the function) is any legal R expression, usually enclosed in { }
- Last evaluation is returned
- return() can also be used, but usually for exceptions.

```{r,echo=T}
f <- function(x)x^2 # this function squares a vector
f(1:3)
``` 

## Challenge 2.2
Write an R function (evens) that filters a vector to return all the even numbers. Use the modulus operator %%, and also logical filtering of vectors. 

```{r,echo=F}
evens <- function(x)x[x %% 2 == 0] 
``` 

```{r,echo=T}
x <- 1:6
x
y <- evens(x)
y
``` 

## Function Arguments
- It is useful to distinguish between  formal arguments and the actual arguments
  + Formal arguments are the property of the function
  + Actual arguments can vary each time the function is called.
- When calling functions, arguments can be specified by
  + Complete name
  + Partial name
  + Position
- Guidelines (Wickham 2015)
  + Use positional mapping for the first one or two arguments (most commonly used)
  + Avoid using positional mapping for less commonly used attributes
  + Named arguments should always come after unnamed arguments

## Function Arguments - Example

```{r,echo=T}
f1 <- function(arg1, arg2, arg3) arg1 * arg2  + arg3
f1(2, 3, 4) # positional
f1(2, arg3=4,3) # name for arg3
f1(arg3=4, arg2=3, 2) # name for arg2, arg3
``` 

## Default Arguments
- Function arguments in R can have default values
- R function arguments are “lazy” – only evaluated if actually used

```{r,echo=T}
g <- function(a=1,b=2) c(a,b)

g()
g(10)
g(10,20)
``` 

## Functions are objects
- Functions are first class objects, so they can be passed to other functions
- Provides flexibility, and widely used in R
```{r,echo=T}
f1 <- function(f,v)f(v) # f is a function object

f1(min,c(2,4,6,7))
f1(max,c(2,4,6,7))
``` 

## Challenge 2.3
Write a function that takes in a vector and returns a vector with no duplicates. Make use of the R function duplicated().
```{r,echo=T}
x <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1)
duplicated(x)
``` 

## Environments
- Environments can be thought of as consisting of two things: a frame, which is a set of symbol-value pairs, and an enclosure, a pointer to an enclosing environment
- Every object (variable or function) in an environment has a unique name
- The working environment is known as the Global Environment
- Environments form a tree structure. The tree of environments is rooted in an empty environment, available through emptyenv(), which has no parent

```{r, echo=F,out.width='80%'}
 knitr::include_graphics("images/06 Envs.png")
```


## Using search() to explore the hierarchy

```{r,echo=T}
search()
``` 

## Functions and Environments
- Functions are first class objects that exist in an environment
- Functions can access all variables contained in their enclosing environment
- If a name isn’t defined inside a function, R will look one level up to the enclosing environment
```{r,echo=T}
x <- 2
g <- function(){
  y <- 1
  c(x,y)
}

g()
``` 

## Functionals
- A functional is a function that takes a function as an input and returns a vector as output
- Commonly used as an alternative for loops
- Common ones
  + sapply()
  + apply()
  + lapply()
  

## Common Pattern (Wickham 2015)
- Create a container for output
- Apply f() to each component of the list
- Fill the container with the results
```{r, echo=F,out.width='50%'}
 knitr::include_graphics("images/07 Apply.png")
```

## sapply()
- The general form of the **sapply(x,f,fargs)** function is as follows:
  + **x** is the target vector or list
  + **f** is the function to be called and applied to each element
  + **fargs** are the optional set of arguments that can be applied to the function f.
- sapply() returns a vector

  ```{r,echo=T}
x <- 1:3
y <- sapply(x,function(v)v*2)
y
```

## apply() - process matrices/data frames

The general form of this function is **apply(m, dimcode, f, fargs)**, where:
  - m is the target matrix
  - dimcode identifies whether it’s a row or column target. The number 1 applies to rows, whereas 2 applies to columns
  - f is the function to be called, and fargs are the optional set of arguments that can be applied to the function f.
  
```{r,echo=T}
m <- matrix(1:10,nrow = 2)
m
apply(m,1,sum) # sum the row
apply(m,2,sum) # sum the columns
```
  

## Summary - Functions
- Functions are a fundamental building block of R
- Functions:
  + are declared using the function reserved word 
  + are objects
- Functions can access variables within the environment where they are created
- Functionals are functions that takes a function as an input and returns a vector as output (can be used as a looping structure)
- The apply family in R are functionals (**apply**, **sapply**, **lapply**)
- The package **purrr** is now being used instead of **apply**

```{r,echo=F,fig.width=2, fig.height=2}
# this is a hack to call plot but make the plot tiny
plot(1:1,axes=FALSE,xlab = "", ylab="",cex = .001)
```
